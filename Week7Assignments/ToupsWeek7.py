# Creates two variables on which a mathematical operation will be performed
distance = 101.5
time = 8.3

# Creates a third variable to store the result of the operation on the previous two
velocity = distance/time

# Prints a concatenated string describing the operation and including all three variables in string form
print("This script divided distance (" + str(distance) + ") by time (" + str(time) + ") and got velocity (" + str(velocity) + ")")
